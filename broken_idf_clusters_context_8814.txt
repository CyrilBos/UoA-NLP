We then have to pay back a minimum amount every month depending on the cumulative total we have loaned at the end of that month so the amount is never fixed, always variable.I ideally want to record the capital we have received (ad hoc), the amount we have paid back (monthly) and the interest as an expense.

Currently Xero see's me buy 50 items (at 17m2 each) and sell 850 items (at 1m2 each).
This is welcomed but remains transaction based and still fails to address the issue of classifying and reporting customers and suppliers by type.
Across all reports.Simply click a column to header to sort report data by that column (a la Quickbooks).
It would be much better if we also had the option of EDITING the timesheet and then approving it.Often it's only a small change, and it completely stops the payroll if a timesheet is incorrect.
I just opened an account with Xero and cannot find a guide anywhere on how to set it up for rental properties.
For example, when we changed a bill of USD 3000 to GBP 3000, the History says:1.
Had this been set to the UK then the list of American states wouldn't have been listed.This really needs changing so that the country defaults to the correct country Xero operates in for the customer, the UK in my case.

This is showing on my profit and loss and I'm wondering if this is correct - as really this is an additional amount of money which should be added to the total cost of goods sold, or inventory cost.How do you all handle this and what's recommended?Thank you.
The standard theme is great, the only problem is logo so small/restrained limited to small narrow window.Please look at increasing the boundaries... even if 400 wide must remain, can we look at 200 high?
HI, I think the cashflow forecasting tool in Xero is a great idea (better executed than in other software due to the payment 'expected date' feature).
Request an Item Costing Report to Include report fields for:  - Item ID/Description  - Date  - Qty Received  - item Cost  - Actual Cost  - Qty Sold  - Remaining Qty  - Remaining value
Hi,I have completed the online application form for a small business I work for to start using auto super.It was done well over a week ago and payments are due very soon.Nothing appears to have been done on it yet, any idea how long it takes for Xero to come back with confirmation that it is ready to go?Thank you

Using this account is unnecessary, no?I would assume that a majority of use cases receive cash upon disposal.
Wouldn't it be nice to send a invoice off to a client via email, where they can pay a invoice online with a credit card using xero!
I currently use sage for bookkeeping and inventory management but writing out the invoices and uploading them to sage is time consuming,  any ideas?
However, I feel it would benefit from having a responsive dashboard that could adapt to the different sized screens used on different computers.
I can customize the range as usual, but this time I can see the last 36 periods (better than only the last 11 periods as it used to be).

The first thing I need to do is reconcile a (non zero) PayPal transfer to my new (zero) PayPal account.
How do I go back and change ordinary hours already processed in a pay run to annual leave taken instead?

It would be great if I could access these PDFs through the mobile app when creating an expense claim, rather than needing to use a desktop computer.Apple provides a Document Picker API precisely for this use case.
I am wondering if it would be possible to have a pop up or alert show up (Like it does when people have money in credit & it says would you like to allocate it to this invoice) but showing that this person (account name) has an overdue account, so it can be followed up with them or so they can pay there overdue accounts while paying for the work they have just had done.

When drawing a report and comparing 2 of the categories, I see unassigned transactions, I then use the find and recode function to change from unassigned to the relevant category.

I do this when reconciling cheques that I have paid into the bank.
But what if you have payments on account or deposits to process?
The only option to get rid of it is to delete it.
It's fantastic that we can upload files etc.
and submit the receipt directly to Xero.
We still have a bunch to do - eventually we'll get there!

Scenario: Employees working for our client need their time sheets approved and their work ethic rated.
I just found out I can upload photos of invoices to Xero using my webcam, then file these images linked to the expense.
We sell a range of zero rated, exempt, taxable and second hand goods so our inventory can get quite confusing.
Currently when doing trading reports in V2 we need to manually enter the Net profit figure in the overall profit and loss.
For example, using Jan-June 2015 and comparing to a prior period will compare to July-December 2014.
Repeating invoices makes this possible but there are still a lot of steps to take and there is no link between the invoice and the journal entries.
I have customers who receive a repeating monthly invoice for services, and might incur additional charges during the month.
I would love the see the following suggestions incorporated in the Activity Statement report, specifically the GST Audit Report.
If you bank all the cheques as individual entries through Receive Money, then you can't split the bank deposit to match up to the Receive Money entries.
When making transfers between accounts the ability to add a narrative would be very useful, especially when banking cash etc
Most of these expenses are paid from a personal account.So I've created an expense claim for each expense, then I split the expense into separate lines...
I'm guessing this is because the Loan Account (using Current Liability) is money the business owes me so hasn't been registered as an expense?
When I create an entry to match the super payment with, do I need to split it, so that I can record it for the two different super funds that are used?
Add custom Incomes & Expenses or adjust the planned dates to see the net cash affect.
<-- well maybe not, payments thing this is a real problem.I created an invoice for catering for $300 (USD).

Their question was if you could use tracking categories to total up the contributions that each donee has made during a year say 1 April to 31 March.
If you change account name or details it would be useful if you have an option at that point for it to update in repeating invoices as well just like it asks you when you update an email address.
Hi,I think it would be helpful if there was a 'Tax expense' account type in the chart of accounts so when we or the client create P&L's it automatically pulls out the tax expense amount and chucks it under profit.
When doing a bank recon, I would like a cell whereby I can add the actually bank amount to make sure my bank balance in Xero agrees to my actual bank balance and the, if so, be able to lock the month unless overridden by an adviser.

HelloWhen sending multiple invoices, you cannot tell from the screen which clients have email addresses (unlike the feature when sending statements).

you have to log onto safari and click Include with Invoice.
Don't understand why this feature has been created for when creating an invoice but not for a bill.
Currently Payment Reference is not one of the filters to add.
For some clients we send Management Reports etc with their BAS.
I feel it would appear less disjointed to the client.
then I would not have to export all my reports to excel.Many thanks
I don't think you can do this easily at the moment, it should just be an option the same as create but select.
It would be great to have this feature applied to both Supplier and Customers.
Sometimes you dont want the detail, you just need to know what is in there.
It would be great if it was possible to turn this feature off for files.
It shows all approved leave dates and who is taking the leave.

Dear Sirs,Regarding the new layout to the system.
I would like to receive payments from clients through Venmo.

Could you add a freight charge box in invoicing, so that it shows separately from line items?
I've come to find that Xero is calculation its average days to pay for individual customers incorrectly.
The location where our employees perform the work is therefore important for accurate tax reporting of income.
At the beginning of the month, customer gets invoiced for that month and has 14 day payment terms.
Reverting these pays to draft reset the tax for that person incorrectly to the current settings, being no HELP deduction.
If in fact I did that (for February) will Xero pick up that I underpaid for the February payroll, and it will automatically catch up in March?
It seems every step of the way I have to find the errors and direct support the needed resolution.

'TICK - Create invoice numbers automatically'.This would be handy instead of having to supply your own invoice numbers as it would allow you to keep them in the same format as invoices created manually on xero.com.I like that you can enter your own invoice numbers, but sometimes you just want auto-generated numbers in the Xero standard format.

I tried setting up two Expenses-Overhead accounts in my Chart of Accounts, one for the GST incl fee and one for the GST excl fee, and then "Pay" the invoice from them.
It would be much more convenient to add telephone numbers to the contact details when editing the address -- though obviously, we don't want the numbers to show on the invoice.
While this is certainly much better than no information about the GST component of any accounting changes, it does also include a lot of clutter!
It would be really useful to show overdraft limits, balance limits and whether accounts charge interest so that expenditure can be spread across the accounts and the impact visible.

Hi Can someone explain where I am going wrongI have bank feeds and credit card feeds, at the minute I am paying the credit card transactions off to the relevant expense account, ie fuel.
I think I know to handle this as an overpayment so I can apply the two payments to the three invoices.The problem is that the amount received in the bank account already includes an international transfer fee from the bank ($20).
I sell a number of items which are vatable, reduced vat, and non-vatable, so the best thing for me to do is the VAT Apportionment Scheme, which essentially takes averages.
The bank is listed in Xero and it states that bank feeds are available, but it specifically states 'Personal Banking' after the bank name, and there is not an option for 'Business Banking'.

Once this is finalized, they pass on the details to the Finance and Admin person creates all invoices (with draft only permission).
Much is made of easy, click 'OK" reconciling with prompts in Xero, but the actual reality is not that straight-forward.
However a standard procedure should be that a bill can't be drafted or created without having a purchase order first - this is a basic "procurement" flow chart.

If you are a hairstylist who uses square to run charges with your phone and you 'create' the invoice on the Square terminal when ringing up the sale - the integration will work (though not if you hoped to have separate line items for 'Service' and 'Products' because the integration wants all sales pegged against a single Revenue account.

Click on the transaction and in the "Reconciled transaction details" screen you should see that it has been matched with a transfer with the wrong date click "Remove & Redo".This will cause the whole transfer to be uncoded so it will pop back up in the other bank account as unreconciled and you will have to code it again.

This looks ridiculous and sends the reader misleading visual cues.
However we often do a quote for a service that will be billed on a recurring basis.

Hi, all, I've been using Xero and Xero Touch for a couple of months.
We would love to be able to create more templates using this feature.
Be great if you could improve search function for Contacts eg.
I regularly attach PDF invoices to the Xero invoice payable.
For many clients we really need just basic stock control.
It should default to the invoice date but one should be able to change that date.
The one let down staring me in the face at the moment is the invoicing system.
Would also be useful for contacts that have different delivery addresses.
For instance we have employees at various centres and the centres are the tracking category.
When an employee looks at a time off request they can see the # of hours requested.
I have full time staff who work on Saturdays and have a day off during the week.
Currently Xero calculates Holiday Pay dollars but not hours.
As a Payroll Administrator, it seems that when I approve the leave, it also schedules it.
It would make sense that this would appear at the top of the report.
(We've had to run a payrun and see who shows up with a zero dollar payslip.)
Hi all,We have stripe set up as a payment service and it works very well.
There is no payment on the Invoice, only one Credit Note.Best Regards,

There is a difference in the Invoice Preview layout and the Print PDF layout.
I am being asked more regularly to send invoices and statements to different emails.

I use due dates to on all their invoices send reminders etc.
When I attach an document from the In Box to a Bill, the document dissapears from the in box.
We've used the custom tags to split the business into department and projects.
We are a service company who raises invoices monthly and 3 monthly.

When I update the invoice date, the due date stays as it was originally.
Allow us to include our Company Logo on email templates2.

The experience gets even better because of the high-class ecosystem it has.
I cannot really see a way of doing this unless I am missing something.
I then received another invoice from the same supplier for computer expense of $100.
This isn't ideal, as I like to see exactly how much there is for each individual supplier.
This happens all of the time and I have, to date, made adjustments, but as I grow that will not be possible.
Hi I am sure this has been requested a million times but is this any nearer to be implemented?
It would also be nice to just show quantity of each item, but not price.

Hi I've allocated an overpayment to a customer (they paid twice), I know it's against the correct account as I can see it in the customer contact screen marked as an overpayment.
I noticed that the tickets numbers changed around then, so assume a new system was put in place, and hoped that eventually it would be sorted out.
Would also be great to have a feature similar to automatic bill reminders so the report can be sent to customers periodically to tidy up open quotes.

Xero could pick up the VAT number, quarter/month end etc and Box 5 figure within the software, and the email function would further enhance our ability to complete everything within Xero rather than use our email system separately.

Please add the ability to "create new account" in the drop down in the accounts dropdown on the reconciliation screen just like it exists in the edit transaction screen.
However, as with most contractors I would presume, I am always required to provide a scanned copy of the receipts relating to expenses that I claim (which are a regular line item on my invoices).
We would in green xero like to be able to sort by subscription, or get a report from xero to tell us which clients that are not on our sub but we have access to their xero file.
However, if there was an extra field available in that list, being Group, or a switch to turn on and off something like "keep group clients together", that would be helpful.
Currently, three reports allow me to see Quantity of Units Sold: Inventory Item Summary, Sales By Item, and Inventory Item Detail.
It would be very handy if they could send supplier's credit note straight from Xero and this action to appear in the history as "sent credit note by email".
One example of this feature being useful is for PayPal transactions where the same Reference is used by PayPal for the payment as well as for the transaction fee – so the two are easily recognised as being linked.

Hi folks,I'm a beginner Xero user and I have some questions relating to the reconciliation of certain items on my company bank statements.
It would be useful to have the ability to add additional office contact details on the firms public profile for practices who have multiple sites.
Your amount will usually be the same if you are creating a rule and you will want to allocate to say two different account codes, you will usually always do this as an amount not a percentage?
If not, a statement on this from Xero would go a long way to reassure me I won't be having to change accounts software in just under 2 year's time!

This creates a nice payables balance for tracking sales tax owed.The problem for me is with the "quick tax" method for HST in Canada and the common sales tax format in the 3 or 4 US states I've worked in.

Since incorporation, I have been able to open up a business account, with the paid up capital being transferred from the lawyer's account to the new business account, where it currently sits.Eventually, could be sooner than later, that $50,000 paid up capital will need to be returned to my own personal account, once the business starts generating sales.How do I record this in Xero?
I'll be using the same credit union that I already use, but I'll be setting up a completely new account, and I'll start using the new account right away for all business transactions.In Xero, it would probably be easiest for me to just edit the bank account number in my chart of accounts, and act as though nothing changed.

To consolidate multiple receipts into a single expense claim and submit it for approval the user has to use the website only to do so - while the mobile app shows all the "draft" receipts the user has entered but not yet submitted for approval, the user cannot select multiple draft receipts and submit them as a consolidated single claim for approval and payment using the mobile app.This is unnecessarily confusing for users - it either leads to a huge increase in individual expense claims submitted for very small amounts, or users saving their receipts and forgetting or not promptly logging into the website to then submit the claim for all those receipts.Mobile apps are GREAT for productivity and doing things on the spot - but not if you then have to go back to the website to complete the task.

When you import a CSV bank statement there is only one option for Amount and it expects a signed number (i.e., positive amounts are received and negative amounts are spent).
For example, if you have an Interest Expense group, it will appear above accounts non-grouped accounts such as Accounting Fees & Bank Charges in the expenses section in the P&L.
Unfortunately, you made it so every account could be moved within the statement EXCEPT the accounts you call "bank" accounts, which includes all of our corporate credit card accounts.

We have a residential investment property and all capital purchases relating to the property must be reported at both G10 and G13.For example, if we replace the guttering or purchase a new air-conditioner or renovate the kitchen at the residential investment property, then these capital purchases must be reported at both G10 and G13.The closest to a solution is to use the "GST Free Capital" tax code in Xero, which results in these purchases being reported correctly at G10, however they are not shown at G13, when in fact they should be.

Whenever I tried posting a manual journal to move the balance from the RE account to Sales, it posted in each account twice - which makes me think that Xero treats these accounts as one in the same.

When I make an actual payment, presumably Xero would take care of it, and the amounts would wind up in the tax expense accounts, right?
Better still, adopt the method used by a competitor of Xero, and that is to show everything outstanding, and also have two options - a)  to only show invoices on which there are outstanding amounts and b) a date chooser.

When setting up Users to approve expense claims, they have to be given "Approve & Pay" access under the "Invoice Only" access.If you have a number of staff approving expense claims, they can see all employee expense claims.
Great feature, but I receive more then 1 invoice from some of our suppliers is there anyway that we can join them together so that when paying you have them loaded only once and gives you a total, like a statement but for our own records.
The ability to reorder journal entry line items or insert new line items between existing line items would be a very useful feature.
On my checking account side I reconcile them as credit card payment, and in the credit card feed I itemize all the individual charges (mouse is computer equipment, etc).

To paint a clearer picture I will outline how I /think/ I might be able to do it:Create a new tax rate called "Sales Tax Abroad, 25%" with the component "High Tax".Create two current liability accounts: "2761 Basis for purchases abroad" and "2760 Set-off: Basis for purchases abroad"Then, when registering the invoice from Xero in Xero:Unit Price, Account, Tax Rate100, "Consulting & Accounting", "Incoming Sales Tax, 25 %"(100), "2761 Basis for purchases abroad", "Sales Tax Abroad, 25%"100, "2760 Set-off: Basis for purchases abroad", "Tax Exempt"The first line subtracts 25 from my Sales Tax account.The second line adds 25 to Sales Tax Abroad, 25%The third line "reverses" the added liability (100) from the second line.In the Sales Tax Report, I get this (Taxes by Component):High Tax:- Sales Tax Abroad, 25% -- Current Liability -- 100 -- 25- Incoming Sales Tax, 25% -- Current Liability -- 0 -- 0- Incoming Sales Tax, 25% -- Expense -- (100) -- (25)- Total High Tax -- 0 -- 0.. which looks OK to me, but it might be more of a dirty fix.Any tips?

Looking at the help guides it appears you either enter your loan as a bank account OR as a non-current liability.

At that time, the PayPal balance was $451.94 so we didn’t have enough PayPal balance to cover that, but they paid the invoice in full.

Hi everyone, I need some help and i have searched all the help topics to no avail.
If this is the case, clients are losing out by subscribing under a xero partner who isn't registered for GST?
Could i then create 2 lines using the opposite % in the discount line?
A company can have multiple contacts each with their own address, phone no., email addr, etc.
It would be great if the link could also work from the invoice to the bill.
We use our own Quote number format and Invoice number format and running number.
A lot of our customers join us on multiple tours, and have to make multiple payments.
This setting could be optional by vendor or a company-wide setting if desired.
In my testing of this issue I also moved this invoice to a new contact (and then back again).
I made a purchase paid using the debit card of my bank account.
Most of our staff are on fixed pay rate but their hours vary from week to week.
Which is creating all the payments to be out etc and its very annoying having to go into each invoice and edit to take off the GST.

If this could be extended so that a paid invoice record is created in the Supplier account from the bank transaction, using the existing screen then these items would correctly appear in Purchases and Sales.For me, Xero is all about working efficiently and this would save lots of time currently spent entering invoices and marking them as paid just to clear the bank reconciliation.

Good evening all, A very (too) simple question from a French newbie who missed one point...Context: we are purchasing fabric, as raw material, to transform it onto garments.Question : I fail to understand where this “raw material” direct-cost should be written on the Chart of Account-Expense column.Im not sure since I would have expected to have it by default on the default “Chart of account” proposed by XERO.Or am I just being "afraid" of creating this own account by myself ?
(we do generate invoices directly within Xero too and we get the same issue).I must stress, this never affects clients paying, they always receive the invoices, so that is not the issue, the problem is the invoices are simply not showing as sent in searches.Any help greatly appreciated.
This causes quite a bit back and forth for us with the auditors re-sending documents that have already been attached.If users with Read Only access could view the supporting docs in the spend/receive money transactions it would eliminate a lot of duplicate work for us and make the process much smoother!

I DO NOT place an email address into the relevant field as all "Cash Sale Clients" will have a different email address.I then raise a quote using "Cash Sale" as my client.
It would save time if the user could manually re-order invoice items so 'most used' appear at the top of menu instead of scrolling down everytime, or the software could do it...or both?
Similar to how the XERO system creates new, sequential Invoice an Quote numbers, there are often times where having the option to select the "next available number" would be useful.
This will allow me to review the list and approve a number at a time, rather than clicking onto detail, then manually going back to the list for the next one.
When approving a bill or invoice, the option to select 'Approve next bill' so that you can go straight to the next draft and approve it without going back to the Purchases screen.

I would love to be able to directly attach invoices/credit notes etc from my customers that are sent by email rather than have to save them first.Is that possible?

This morning when I work on the Bank Account Reconciliation screen and I want to click on either the Cash Coding, Account Transactions or Bank Statement Tabs, nothing happens.
I changed the description text to see if it was just the first condition field that wasn't saving and it did update the description text and the name of the rule so it must just be those top conditions that aren't saving.

To add to the confusion the Contact record provides for Postal Address and Street Address, with invoices going to the Postal Address (and Street Address seemingly being unused in Xero).
I don't want to keep recording all these transactions just to find out that theres no way to take that company and tie it to a new user so it is completely separate from my other business and personal account.

A Direct payment doesnt show up on their statement at all.The splitting of payments across invoices is probably necessary, but creates confusion for the customer as they would expect to see a payment of $70 that they made, not a payment of $65 & then another amount of $5.
This way if you are doing catch up work for a client you could 'load' the documentation first and then you can select the correct documentation relevant to the correct period while reconciling etcTo prevent removal or replacement of attached documents during a subsequent 'remove and redo' of a transaction a prompt screen should appear with the option to either leave the document(s) attached to the actual transaction or not.

Hi, For the past couple of days my bank feed in Zero has not updated, there has been changes to my bank account and they are not showing up on Zero.
As Xero is having the function of Expected Payment Date, it would be great if we could generate a summary list/report according to expected payment date.For example, if several contacts are expected to pay today, we can then generate a summary (similar to those tracking summary) under today's date that we would know which contacts are supposed to pay by today.This function really helps in terms of tracking and chasing up payments; otherwise, we can only find one's expected payment date when we click into the particular contact to look for the expected payment date.
But with Xero these transactions are unable to be imported into a credit card account within Xero, so more frustrating to reconcile and keep track of.Appreciate if anyone knows of a work around or way to sort this issue.

It would be a genius feature to allow users to enable a feature to number items.For those of us creating inventory as we sell it, when we add a new item to our inventory,many times we don't have a numbering scheme already in-place to number new items.
The Xero at present do not allow to make an inventory adjustment as void or edit it.At least for a positive adjustment in the item editing should be allowed to change the price and account later on.
Having the option of showing the monthly profit or loss on the graph would be good too.If you could customise the graph so you could change it to Year to date that would also be good.

The retailers typically ask us to give them invoices for each consignment piece up front, and then they will only pay the invoice once they sell the item.This makes our lives a bit difficult, because the "Due Date" of the invoice isn't fixed - it is related to the sale date of the item.

Hi there, As our business has grown and we've setup more and more direct debits where our suppliers can take what they're owed by us at the end of the month or the following month or similar, the number of invoices sitting in 'bills' column looking like they're overdue gets a bit out of control.
Currently all taxes to be paid get lumped into Accounts Payable along with any outstanding supplier POs, and there is no way to specify otherwise without doing a manual adjustment.

If you have many options, I instinctively click the button at the top of the list (a new category) only to have to remember to jump to the bottom of the page.
i receive the following error message:The imported file SERVSALE.TXT contained 1 invoice.

As part of my job I have to obtain updates on all sales ledger invoices outstanding and apply comments to each invoice, however when I download a report to excel showing all invoices due for payment none of the notes I have added on Xero show on the report.
But when I go into the "Expense Claims" section by clicking on the link in the widget, no expense claims are shown for me or any other users.The amount that is showing in the widget lines up with a receipt that was submitted, I believe via mobile, and may have been incorrectly submitted as an expense claim and later deleted/changed - I am not sure about this.

Hey guys,Started using Xero and going to be making my first purchase order for printing services for my customer.
In Washington State businesses must pay a Use Tax on all items that when purchased, do not have sales tax added on the sale.
I always push invoices through to xero and send out from there so I have to seperate it all in xero by adding lines and typing manually which is very time consuming.
Currently the Xero balance displayed for bank accounts is as of the date you're in the system and does not include post dated transactions.
It would be great if we could change text size and colour in invoice reminder say the word  or  in bold larger and red.
In MYOB, I could save Invoices as recurring transactions.So all I did, was to call up the transaction for this supplier and I just had to change the date and amount and I was done !!!!!!!

I have taken over a set of accounts and there are a large number of issues dating back to 2013 - Customer, Supplier and bank accounts have not been reconciled.

once a week I deposit my cash takings to my bank account, then from Xero, I select the cash deposit and click 'Find and match'.

My intent is to sell every part from that dishwasher (obviously that could take some time though as you have to find the right buyer) so essentially all of the parts inside would be inventory items (by the way, I'm only buying one model of dishwasher here, so I would likely replenish my stock levels of parts I'm running low on by purchasing another whole dishwasher).I want to bring those parts into inventory but I'm unsure of how to do this in Xero.

What we need is another option on the PO side to the PO to an existing bill within Xero and mark the PO as "billed".
Then all I would have to do is just add new clients to the Xero Medium or Xero Large group and all the invoicing would happen automatically.
we have 1000's of inventory items stored, so it is impossible to keep track of exactly much each item costs at any one time.

They have overlooked that many businesses use PO's as an internal control function and to mange their budgets.
it says something like "Payment received from {Customer} on {Date} for {Amount} with reference {Reference}.

I want to run a previous year to ensure that all b/fwd figure are correct.
So each month I want to know what the total dollar value is for item 1 on invoices with a category a.

Hi there, i recently formed a company, and as part of that process the formation company we used provided us with a cheque for cashback which ive paid into the business account.We paid for the formation costs out of our personal money (as the business account didnt exist before this).I've now got to reconcile this cheque in Xero, but no idea which code to use.
My POS gives plenty of figures, however due to not banking often, Xero customer care thought using the sales figures from our bank statement would be a more true indication of income as EFTPOS is deposited immediately, customers pay accounts with direct credit and cash and cheques are eventually banked.

Right now Xero allows to specify the following:- default tax rate for inventory items- default tax rate for accounts- default tax rate for contactsIt seems like there is a priority that's not clearly specified because setting a default sales tax rate for a contact always wins when creating an invoice no matter what the item or account is set to.

Customizable reports for these cases would be nice.The current approach is to use categories – which is time intensive and cumbersome.A much better, faster and easier solution would be a report that searches for countries and regions in the transaction addresses.

It's a good job Xero saves time in other areas because it deals with this really badly!Also why can't you enable overpayments on batch deposits - do Xero not understand that if you have multiple pay clients that their payments will not always exactly match the invoice (we so wish that they did).

To go back to the Expense Claim you were reviewing you need to click "back page" on your browser, or go back into the Accounts>Expense Claim module, then click the "Awaiting Authorisation" tab, then click on the Expense Claim you were looking at to open it up again.Very simple changes would make the report actually useful and efficient to use.

I try to create a rule, but it makes me give a contact name for every little transaction.
Issue 1: My vendor has made a single payment towards multiple invoices and has short paid by 5% on each of these invoices.
love the new feature but would prefer opening default to statements rather than statement lines
However, there is no simple relationship between individual daily sales and the amount we actually receive from the card company.
It must be a reasonably normal business activity so I would like to know if other customers have found a solution to this.
Please can the layout of entering go nominal (account) code first, then the description, then the amount?
If the confirmation is incorrect either funds were not received or cheque was not cleared they it is still an outstanding invoice but reminders are not being sent.
and accept them online that would be a great time and paper saver instead of printing everything out and chasing them for signatures.

Hi there, I have just started learning how to use XERO -so excuse me if this is a little basic.I have been entering my invoices into xero as sales.
There is often the need for a back-up Excel schedule to be added as a supporting document into a section in Xero workpapers.
At the end of the year the accountant wants to see when super payments were actually made for each employee, not when they were accrued.
ie serial numbers, colour, etc and would like to be able to see this if she runs a report.
As we sometimes post or hand hand out the original invoice but quite often need to resend which is  done by email.
We request a credit from a supplier with a Credit Reference Number and the supplier issues the credit with their own reference number.
I find the redesigned "receive money" page a bit frustrating to use, for a couple of reasons: 1.
Just not efficient which always bothers me.I can make an invoice so easily that is loaded with our inventory items and prices etc.
Another example, I have an order which is recognised in my Sales as £100 but nothing is recorded at all in my Cost of Goods Sold.
As you all probably know you can only have one draft pay run and one draft timesheet at any given time.
If so this requires a manual calculation on each employee, which is particularly tedious when paying casuals who do not work a set pattern of hours.
Any tips?Automate Import Invoices, Receipts, Payments, Items and other entities from Excel to Xero.
I am suspicious though of hosted solutions for my company's financial data and I see nothing on this site to reassure me.

I have customers pay into the statement account and then transfer any balance over around $100 into my interest bearing account so that grows.
Is it possible either within xero or via an add-on to have an invoice created in xero when a customer makes an online purchase via payment express?
If it was possible to double-click on the dollar amounts in the fields for Total sales and income Box 5 and Total purchases and expenses Box 11, it would then make it much easier to transpose these two amounts into the MyIRd website.
There's no way to attach documents to the employee record, which would allow the payroll component of Xero to function as a basic (yet suitable) HR system.

I realise this may be because it is a function that sits under settings but if they could have access to do it just from the invoicing screen that would be great.I approve all invoices my staff create anyway so I have no concern with them creating an incorrect tracking code.

I note that on the mobile app I can bill and expense claim, but it looks like it only takes a photo of a receipt but not a file upload, like of a pdf of an airline receipt.For billable expenses though it looks like I have to bill myself for the expense so I can add the expense to the invoice.
My client doesn't want the Summary and Ratios (doesnt understand) nor the Cash summary ( not needed) However they would like also a Specific Event P&L (Mothers day Fun run for example ( which I 'track') and a suppliers invoice report (so they see who and how much I have paid) So now they get THREE pdf files.
This account is kind of an amalgamation of both credit cards.The problem is if I am trying to reconcile our working bank account in Xero, there might be a single transfer of $1,000 but it could represent $500 from credit card 1 and $500 from credit card 2.
A subsequent data entry page asked if I was using Pin Sentry (Y/N) and either answer here took me to another page where I was asked to input my Pin Sentry code.The very nature of this connection method means that it is only good for a specific connection window (about 90s), since Barclays require the re-authentication of subsequent sessions, which will require the Pin Sentry code being entered.In essence, what is being created here is a proxy user connection which is a *massive* security risk and should be used with extreme caution.

However some vendors charge tax at the time of sale because they aren't set up to handle resale customers.In this case, the sales taxes paid on goods for resale may be used as an offset against sales tax liability (the forwarding of sales taxes collected on goods sold to the taxing authority).How should I set up Xero so when I pay sales taxes on goods purchased for resale I can see those amounts on my sales tax report and properly deduct them from my sales tax liability?

Our learning experience from this is: When working with XERO, DO NOT let non-employees have control of your XERO Subscriptions – this must all be done internally.
For instance if one is interrupted by a phone call, or simply because this is the n-th PO to be processed and you are just not concentrating.

Could there be a function added that you can choose to allow when a log in session has finished that (if chosen) when you log in next you are taken to the last screen that you were on in your last session?I would think this to be a system choice set to each specific log in (and something that would be a choice when you send the user invite).We would like to allow certain people within our organisation access to reports but know some will be overwhelmed with having to navigate to different parts to get that report.

Bit of a long shot this one...I have taken over a bookkeeping job on Xero and I have a difference between my VAT report and the trial balance.
It's really tedious doing this process, especially with an existing client who is new to xero with and existing COA (eg they may have come from MYOB).

We end up with fractional unit pricing but Xero is calculating line amounts and totals with inconsistent rounding rules.
Please could you explain how I can solicit the deposit, record it in Xero and then apply it to the invoice for the venue booking so either after or just before the envent, the customer is being invoiced the net amount.
I need to add components and change the actual rateI've emailed support but the collective wisdom on here might be faster.
For instance, when an invoices gets to be more than ten (10) lines, it becomes quite onerous to move lines around in the right order.
It would be helpful to have a TAB on the Invoice screen for UNSENT invoices - to pick up only those that have been APPROVED (not DRAFT invoices).
I found it hard that I have to always refer to the latest quote/invoice for the running number before creating the new quote/invoice.

So, I created a bill, approved it and entered the payment date and account and saved it.The only problem is that I accidentally entered the wrong account from which the payment was made.
There must be a simple way to record 'Cash expenses" or expenses paid with "personal funds/accounts"  as a sole trader in Xero I had cashflow manager and it had a simple option you either placed the expense in the "Bank" Or "Cash" Column.
having read somewhere in this community, i have setup the account for the FD as current asset.now, the FD has matured and the bank has transferred the amount to our bank account.
Do I need to set up a new Xero company for each one (like they are currently doing) or can I use one Xero company and delineate between the companies within that through job number usage?
HiI am new to Xero and I want to set up a budget that includes details of expenses rather than the summary of the expense categories as per the Budget Manager.
Having made a complete b***s up of a paypal account when I first started using Xero, I've now decided to delete all the bank statements and start again (now I have some idea of what I'm doing!)
As an alternative, perhaps there could be a "text wrap" in that field within your coding group so that the reference field would be shown completely, even in the portrait format that now exists.
The idea being that clients often don't need to see certain accounts when they are allocating transactions as they just result in confusion (for example borrowing costs write off, accumulated depreciation, building write off, prepayments).
When I email one of my customized forms (invoice, PO, etc) the email message that comes with it, either the Basic one or one I customize, has a bug.
Hi All,One of our customer has made payment directly to our supplier instead of us.The customer invoice and supplier invoice are booked.Now I want to debit supplier and credit customer through Journal.

Therefore the VAT Return on Xero does not agree with the VAT Return Submitted to HMRC?Also, Xero does not bring this amendments into the next VAT quarter, like Sage / Quickbooks would so the VAT is still not being accounted for?How do I change this?Thanks
It would be really helpful if there was a warning when a 'purchases' VAT type was selected when entering a sales invoice and vice versa.I have had clients inadvertently select the purchases code when entering a sales invoice and the chances of that being an error have got to be over 99.9%.It would also be helpful if income entries on the VAT return were separated from purchases (as Sage do) to make miscodings more obvious.My client continually selects 'no vat' when it needs to be 'zero rated income' and it is so difficult to identify as the entries get mixed in with the tons of 'no vat' entries.

To treat the deferred revenue, I feel the Pre-payment option in Receive money transaction a suitable measure to address my issue.
Because they are imported however, I'm not charged GST on the service.The ATO requires such scenarios to 'reverse charge' the GST - in my case, this means I have to pay the GST component in my BAS.
I am needing a report that I can generate monthly that details the transactions of my bank accounts it must include: INCOME date, invoice no, debtor, transaction description amount.
In this scenario, all Tax Rates on the copied invoice default back to the Default Tax Rate, rather than keeping the line item Tax Rates from the invoice you have copied.

This means if you set up a repeating invoice for the last day of the month in a month that does not have 31 days the next time a 31 day month comes around the invoice will be generated and sent before the last day of the month - February is a good example of this but any 30 day month has the same problem.So this means you either have to wait for a month with 31 days to set up the repeating and manually enter invoices until this time or enter the repeating for the last day on a non 31 day month and go back to change to the 31st for the next month with 31 days.

Hello,my new accounting year starts from may 2016however I would like to bring over my detailed aging customers receivable and vendors payable from my old accounting systemis there a way to do this?
Contact should look more like an address book database where one can define multiple fields for a given contact at will.I would also like to see 1 to 3 shipping account fields.
Also, the 'new reports' are unable to break out a report for each contact, so rather than getting receivable invoice detail unique to the contact we're focusing on, we receive a huge report for all of our contacts, again hundreds of pages long.
However, I cannot check attachments from the reconcile screen - I need to open up the "Find and Match", then open the specific bill in another tab before I can confirm that the receipt has been attached.It would be wonderful if the reconcile window included the "attachments" button showing the number of attachments and enabling them to be viewed.

I've read a few different solutions on the Xero Community, most of which center around the idea in this like.It's not very convenient if you want to make sure and have the cost hit the original expense account.
This works fine.I then generate a sale of this product and the sale is recorded OK (Sale vs. Accounts Receivable).The problem is that the COGS is not calculated and the inventory is not decreased.
Then I recorded two lines under this one transaction, one for interest received which I put under Interest Income (code 270).
I used Find and Recode today to recode many transactions and a few small improvements would have made things much faster: 1.
But that means the client will receive the invoice with an outstanding balance, even though they are expecting it to be paid already (because of their pre-payment on the 10th).

When creating a new contact in a Sales Invoice, you just type in the name, I use the company name usually.When you click "add address" you get a box which has an "attention" field, which is great.Except that doesn't fill the Contact Person name fields in the contact :(It does add the email though.So.Please have the attention field put in the name (for emails) at least.ORHave the contact person name fields in the "add address" pop up, so it can all be done in one place.OrIs there some other easy way to edit the contact person name?

If a customer owes money against invoices it clearly shows this.However if a customer has made prepayments, it shows the customer balance as zero.It would be really helpful if there were any prepayments to show the customer balance as a negative number.We have found it virtually impossible to see at a glance the size and amount of customer prepayments.A lot of our customers pay by direct debit which are effectively prepayments and to say there balance is zero when they have paid us money is madness.If this feature was put right (and it must be a simple update) then in my view Xero would be nearly perfect.

Additionally, the "Amount Paid" field in the "Make a payment" box defaults to the amount that Xero thinks is left to pay (and this amount is normally the invoice amount less the amounts listed below the invoice total as already paid).However, we have two invoices where there are no payment amounts below the total shown for the bill, yet Xero shows a part payment in the "Paid" column if we view bills that are "Awaiting Payment" and, furthermore, the default amount in the "Make a payment" section is the difference between what is shown in "Awaiting Payment" list and the invoice total!

Hello,I just sold a motor vehicle, which was registered on the Fixed Assets register with the correct purchase date, amount and depreciation.Can you advise me when I create the journal of the sale, For "Account to debit for sale", which account I have to choose, because I selected the other revenue account, but I'm not sure that this is the correct one?When reviewing the journal entry, it's asking for accounts for Loss on Disposal and I selected Gain/Loss on sale of asset.
My problem starts when I suspected that things were not adding up in my accounts payable.I decided to research a company I purchase from regularly.I searched for their name and found several invoices missing from the list.I tried then still in the accounts payable to search for one of the missing invoice reference numbers and xero found nothing.So I gathered that this invoice was not in the system so I tried to create a new invoice in xero for this.When I put the ref number in (the one that I searched for and got no results) xero tells me that an invoice with this ref number exists.It even give me a link to followThis link leads me to a blank invoice.

Hello,We started into looking at integrating our inventory solution with Xero.I just wanted to ask for some real customer feedback on what is "the must have" for this integration?What kind of features are expected ?
Could we please have an option similar to MYOB where you can select multiple accounts in the Account Transaction Report and have the choice to print on one page or each account on a separate page.
It would be great to have an additional page to amended Activity Statement (AS) forms to show the previous figures, revised figures and net adjustments made to make it clearer to clients what their adjusted obligation is.
Currently we can seperate clients into groups and have Name / Account Number in colums as well as every other line of data associated with that client - except for amount own.
It would be great if you could sort by month say have twelves tabs for every month and you can code only those transactions and save and reconcile only those transactions.
One example I am thinking right now is when I, as approver of expense claims and invoices, will receive notifications that new draft invoices/claims were sent to me for approval.
I have a couple of clients that need this, the current workaround from Xero is to create the invoice once in Xero, then create it again - manually - in Word or Excel, which is not ideal to put it mildly!
It would be really good if generating a pay run automatically created an invoice that could then be matched with the payment in the bank feed and reconciled.

One of our client organisations operates under HMRC Flat Rate scheme and has two separate trading divisions.
Within the Aged Receivables Reports include a column which details the date of the last payment received by the customer (contact).
Eg  an option for the user to approve drafts, and see read only sales invoices receipted and bills paid.Thanks
Each receipt should just "magically" show up in their right account with the right receipt/report dates without any further user intervention nor work around.
Currently if an employee or director has an allowances such as 'meal allowance - domestic' or 'travel allowance - domestic' - you have to record them as a reimbursement.
I have a bunch of unfinished invoices that I would like to change to drafts however I can only find an option to update the invoices.
Linking a credit card to Xero works perfectly, but many of our transactions are international ones and Kiwi Bank (potentially others?)
I have expense accounts set to "tax exempt", yet I found my sales tax account to have a balance.
So here goes:Have two accounts - joint and credit card accounts.Transferring payments from joint acct to credit card acct.
All expenses were made using a personal credit card.I want to reimburse based on a per diem rate.
I have narrowed it to 4 employees each with a different Super Fund (though others in the payrun have the same as the 4 that are allocated correctly).
My most recent attempt has yielded the following response "The opening balance date can't be changed because this employee has a published payment summary".

However, I have since added my Business bank account which received the combined payments from stripe every 2-3 days and now have a dilemma.
(we can avoid duplicate employee records since we cannot merge duplicate employees records specially there payroll transactions during year end)It would also be helpful if we can put the history and notes field that will show what has been changed or added to the employee's record just like the history and notes functions in the bills module.

For a variety of reasons we have a client with multiple Xero files for their company which has one ABN and a "branch" ABN number for each business name under the company (10 and growing).Each runs completely separately - premises, payroll, creditors, customers, bank accounts etc etcWe seem to have an issue with setting up Auto superOn first pass we seem to need to pay from one account and nominate one ABN for ALL the payments.That will mean I spend time doing journals and payments to & from each branch, not an optimal solution.Has anyone else hit this issue, or have any suggestions how to overcome the problem.

I like the feature where files are able to be emailed directly to Xero, except without looking into the files option or notifications, you don't know that new files have been uploaded.
When you go into the Bills screen, if you click on all there should be another column with Date Paid and the due date then becomes blank once complete payment has been made against the bill.
To do that you need to log into the website, go into the Expense Claim module, find the receipt you want to delete under the "Current Claims", and delete it there.
We mostly add Repeating invoices, and so a one click from the home page would be much quicker, as its only available from within submenus currently.

It would then be nice that while I am in inventory looking at an item that I realize needs to be ordered that I can create a PO with that item and the supplier details are filled in automatically from those fields.
To do this you must remove/redo the reconciled batch payment, which for us is mostly large, make your adjustments or even void the invoice and then process the entire batch report again.
MYOB has a feature for all recurring items where you can select an option to use previously updated journal/purchase etc and this actually becomes a huge time saver.Thanks!

If you don't use automated bank feeds the manual bank reconciliation process is easy, you can tick from a list of transactions and then reconcile a whole batch of them together by selecting "mark as reconciled".Once you have bank feeds enabled, this facility no longer exists and the only method of manual reconciliation is to open up each individual transaction and then select "mark as reconciled" against each one.

Hi,I have a conversion balance for accounts receivable, but these include amounts from the previous year which were journaled in the old system, so no specific invoices allocated.So I have for instance 500 000 outstanding invoices, but my balance is 600 000 as there is 100 000 from the previous year.How should I sort this?

However, if a docx template is being used rather than the Xero standard template, the online invoicing picks up the postal address and so the company registered office shows at the top of the online document.

Separately, but related: where bank feeds aren't actually available, the "bank feeds are available" button shouldn't continue to be displayed.
It would be great to have the option to have a different name for the payee name.An example would be that I have two contractors with the same name (son and father).
Our firm uses ledgers for tax work which is making the 'My Xero' homepage very cluttered and time consuming to find files.
Would be very helpful to be able to select multiple foreign currency invoices (of the same currency) and mark as paid in one payment.
I don't believe that there needs to be a seaperate Overpayment or Prepayment API necessarily because we do have the ability to create Credit Notes via the API currently.
The import file defaults to the company's functional currency, one then has to access each individual invoice and manually adjust the respective invoices' currency.
Most banks have paying in machines that take an image of any cheques paid in and it would be handy to attach these banking receipts to the corresponding bank statement line.

So there was never any permanent damage done.Following this ill-conceived change, the only way to delete duplicate statement lines is to go "fish" out the line in the bank statement screen, as the ability to delete statement lines from the reconciliation screen has been completely removed.In effect, the recent change has eliminated a straightforward process that already had  security in place (warning + somewhat complex undelete) and replaced it with a complex delete process.

Hi All,I wanted to find out how other users reconcile deposits from a merchant bank account?We have an online store and each day the credit card payments customers make are deposited as a lump sum, making it impossible for Xero to match the receivable invoices to the payment, as the amounts don't match 1 for 1.Is it a matter of picking through the invoices and splitting the batch payment across the related invoices?

I am not an accountant, and I get confused over the advice given in Xero help guides on accounting for shareholder dividends.
Ideally I would like to have as much pre-printed as possible and just print the variable fields on each invoice.
When importing purchases / bills, then editing said bills you do not get an error if the totals mismatch.Eg.
Every time I set up a new organisation I have to hide them, even though I have done this over 100 times.
For those who use both Xero and WorkflowMax, it would be great if you could login once to Xero and be able to access your WorkflowMax under the My Xero tab.

Currently on repeating invoices, our customers have no idea what service period they are paying for and this is causing confusion.

Xero to Xero is a great feature and certainly helps with on-charging between related entities etc.Would it be possible for the Xero network to handle credit notes as well?This would help ensure each business is showing the correct amount due etc.
When days vary from the standard days this field is normally overlooked as it sits at the bottom of the payslip.Can you confirm how Xero calculates Annual Leave and if it uses the days paid field to do that?Most payroll systems ask you enter time by day, so I assume they use that to calculate average earnings.

You just need to go into the other bank account (Account #2) and match it.If you code it as a transfer in both bank accounts you end up with unreconciled transfers in each account.TIP: Code the transfers in one bank account and then  go into the other bank account and match them.

Alternatively however (and this may be more inline with the existing ability to apply an overpayment to an already approved invoice) it would be sufficient if you could open a repeating invoice, and if an overpayment exists, have a messaged displayed indicating an overpayment exists for this client and a link allowing it to be applied to the next approved invoice.

I have a client who receives a lot of monthly bank receipts from the same people for the same amount every month, it would be great to be able to set up recurring bank receipts instead of having to create invoices for each and every receipt.
Unfortunately, payment was made to the fraudulent bank account with no recourse from the client's bank.When we were made aware of the situation we went through the uncomfortable process of contacting customers who were invoiced around the same time.

I've got a rather unique situation and I'm unsure how to handle it in Xero.Several months back I overpaid a vendor by $870.
I want to make sure I am selecting the correct Account Types.I also use services from other suppliers which I do not mark up.
When I mark the invoice paid in that billing program it marks it paid in xero and creates a transaction in my bank account.
Cost of goods sold does not quite make sense from an accounting perspective when paying out commissions for example.
Something like Date _/_/_ -  _/_/_, it will be really helpful.
I hope this makes sense and if Xero can handle this without going to an outside source to integrate, that would be awesome.
I then email quotation to the client by manually placing an email address in the relevant field and hit send.
I found it easier to track transfers and reconcile accounts by treating my contributions and draws as a "bank account".
Please please please allow the Practice database to be able to remain open whilst you move between databases.

When there are two or more deposits in bank statement lines relating to one batch deposit, it does not allow you to partly pay the batch and then apply the next deposit from the bank statement line.There should be a feature to allow you to part pay or split the deposit batch to allow the next statement line to be applied against the deposit.
Hi,Cash codding is fantastic feature to reconcile bank feeds but there are few more features required.1) Xero should AUTOMATICALLY suggest inter bank transfer in cash codding.2) Should also add feature of matching  invoice with payment 3) It should have option to split transaction and Bank fees in the same.
My thoughts are that there should be three levels of "lock periods":1) Lock period (ie at EOM/EOQ) done by client - good habit to be in2) Lock period (ie at EOY prior to finalisation of accounts) - done by accountant (only accountants/advisor can do do entries/make changes before the lock period date3) Lock period (ie at EOY post finalisation of accounts) - done by accountant/advisor (no one can change entries before the lock period date (unless the date is removed))P.S.

We have a large number of supplier invoices and to have to enter a separate Purchase Order then transfer this as a bill takes far too long.
reduce the PP current asset balance and adjust the monthly charge in the P&L each month.
For no logical reason you currently can't save an account where a line item on a purchase order is $0.00.
It might be worth changing that term in Xero, as clients may think that we can give financial advise also.
I'm aware of tracking and I know I could also slim down the chart of accounts - but is anyone aware of a feature like this in Xero.
Some debtors pay extra for the next invoice however, in Xero you need to create a received money transaction.
At the top of the screen I get a message: "You'll be able to process payroll from the start of the new financial year in April.

Since moving to the new Go Cardless integration in Xero, I am having issues with reconciliation.

I am on Xero multi currency plan, but this still does not help me because Paypal does not have an export tool that converts USD payments and receipts into AUD.I looked at an add-on called Receipt Bank, but I have about 800 reconciles in my Xero, their plan maybe too expensive.

I reconcile the charges against the various expense accounts (marketing, m&e, etc) directly from the feed.I make a payment to the credit card at end of month but I have no way to reconcile against the credit card bank feed directly.Am I missing something?My thinking is that my original reconciliation from the credit card charges bank feed should be into a liabilities account (that I need to set up - holding account?)
This means that the clients have been invoiced for an item before it has actually been purchased from the supplier, so as far as I can see there is no way of allocating the billable expense for the item to the correct customer invoice as it has already been approved and paid for.The allocation of billable expenses to a client appears to only apply when a supplier invoice has been approved.

something goes awry and despite Receiptbank getting it correct, Xero then assumed different rules around Tax and ASSUMES tax even if there was none on the receipt or invoice.So this is adding DOUBLE my time and means that the 100+ receipts I have published now need to be gone through each one by one.

I was surprised to find out that Xero contains single account for Accounts Receivable and Payable.
one day in the last couple of months, I have done my bank reconciliation.
I sold my business car and buyer of the car paid directly to bank loan.
For example, we transferred US$22,471.91 or PHP1,000,000.
We use eWay as our payment gateway for online debit and credit card payments.
I would like to know how other people are accounting for Stripe fees inside Xero.
If you submit your expenses via a PC you get one set of GL accounts.
This feature would be more helpful if it did NOT display contacts that have been archived or merged - just the current contacts.
Generally when entering invoices/bill you enter more than one so this would speed up the process.
However, it seems to me that you still need to raise an invoice in the system for the full amount.
This would save 4 clicks and the associated waiting time per employee.
I have been logged in to Xero for around the last 5 hours working on a complex invoice.
If this isn't an "appropriate way"  of doing this, I'd be interested in knowing the accounting reason why.Thanks in advance.Jerry

Hi,We became VAT registered on 1st July and have a year end of 31st March '16.Our sales prior to 1st July don't show VAT, which is good, but our payable invoices were always added as Expenses with 20% VAT.
If I enter invoices with the same invoice number (This happens regularly as some invoices have no numbers & the invoice date is used instead) but different contact names, Xero imports the separate 'Contact Names' as the first name only when the 'Invoice Number' is the same.
It would be really useful to have the ability to use wildcards in setting up the conditions when applying a bank rule.For example if a Payee starts with 'Z *' it could apply a Motor Vehicle 90%/10% rule.
When creating a customer contact form, a great field to include would be the rep on record which populates from a Group titled Reps. Of course the rep contact would need to be added to the group.
The two codes would be interchangeable and relate back to the same inventory item so that no matter which of the two codes you used it would pull through the same description and price info as well as still count the quantity purchased and sold in the existing reports.
Occasionally I like to review an invoice when using the auto match feature from bank reconciliations.i.e if the bank reconciliation finds a match, if you click 'find and match' to review the transaction you cannot drill down into the actual invoice.

When we received a payment in this account that was other company's service we did a receive money and decrease the balance.We did something similar with ATO Integrated account.
On the contact, sometimes there is more than one account the gets debited to that particular contact and needs more than one account - It would be nice to be able to store more than 1 account in a contact.
When selecting due date for sales, the option of adding days after the end of invoice month can only be a maximum of 99 days since Xero allows entry of only two digits.
We are a service based company that runs multiple programs and so it would be very useful to be able to create a different sales invoice email template for each different program.
When importing bills there is no column for the ABN to also be imported (only when importing contacts) so when Xero automatically adds a new contact from the import there is no ABN set up.
We had looked at using the report templates in our firm last financial year and it was lacking to many things for us to think that it was worth implementing.
The same applies to contacts that are not exact - Xero creates a new contact.Please can you add a feature (like the Would you like to update contact address details?

Hi All,It would be great if it was possible to lock the chart of accounts from being changed by certain users (particularly clients).Currently anyone with Standard access or above can manipulate the chart as they like.
We order stock to clients' orders and I have recently added a dozen orders off the back of the trade show, and would like to use these orders as the basis for a purchase order to our supplier.
Alternatively, it could be managed by being able to edit the details of the inventory items directly from the purchases screen (and preferably from the invoices screen), whilst they are being data entered, rather than having to go into the separate inventory section.
I would like to create a report that would allow me to "audit" an account to see how many kegs they have outstanding.I can sort of get there using the Receivable Invoice Detail report.

We have customers that we invoice monthly for a set amount per day, so this can be 28,29,30 or 31.I want to set this up in repeating invoices and most of the features I need are there, I can add placeholders to say what month is being invoiced, set it up for the 31st as the invoicing date and it will invoice on the last day of the month.
Suggestion: Mark them out of 10 for: 1) ease or use 2) layout presentation3) pages it unnecessarily takes up4) time it takes to build a basic report with useful data from the default options

At the moment you have to click through the "copied to bill" links individually and add up the bill totals.It would be very handy if the approved purchase orders would list the applied bills amounts underneath the purchase order total, in much the same way as an approved bill shows the payments applied against it underneath the bill total.
So basically need to be able to add the company name, accounts email address, phone number etc, then also need the ability to add individual contacts under the same contact/company with their own contact emails, addresses, phone numbers etc.
it would be really good if Xero could fix this so the correct standard hours appear in My Payroll.Also you need to do separate leave requests if you want a part leave day.

Quite often for clients, this means having to jump in and out of the pay run to show leave taken by an employee.It'd be wonderful if leave taken could be done during the pay run - by adding the different leave types as 'earning lines' within the individual employee's pay run details.

We try to tell clients if an invoice is paid to wait until it appears on the bank feed to allocate it to an invoice.
In many corporates, this is ideal as we lock off the accounts each month to provide reports for the board and are unable to adjust prior month figures.

Hi,The drag and drop function is a great improvement, very useful.Although, most of the files we need to attach are invoices received via email and it would make it so much easier to drag and drop the file directly from the email into Xero.
I would do this for one Add-On and then the next - all my time spent gathering information from one party and passing it onto my client.
That is, services such as Rerun and Bill.com offer ACH payments, but only on invoices originating in their systems (no 2-way sync with Xero).
After all, it isn't long since Xero increased its monthly fee with no notice.Two days later, Xero sent another email saying that due to the "passionate response" from its customers, there would now be a choice whether to adopt the service.
There are a bunch of other things Xero COULD be doing in my opinion, but some updates are better than no updates, and at least the focus is around the core product which is bookkeeping, banking, invoices etc.

Hello, I am new to Xero and I have a few questions regarding expense claims.Questions:1) Will the expense claim report always be titled with the user who inputted the expense claim?
Hi .. we're starting to use Xero for my daughter's two small retail shops a couple of months into the UK tax year (currently she uses a mixture of hard copy accounting ledgers and a spreadsheet).
I have worked out two possible options (I have also read a few community forum feeds) but they both have pro's and cons.Am I best to go in and apply the whole payment taken (invoice amount plus cc surcharge) - which would then result in an over payment and then create an additional invoice that covers the surcharge amount and then apply it to have that one paid out in the system?
Have a cafe who like most, receives mostly cash payments from customers (some eftpos & credit card) Some small expenses are paid out of the till.Is it best to record the full amount of the takings as a Receive Money transaction, then the expenses as a Spend Money and reconcile against the bank account once banked?eg: takings = $200 expenses = $45 reconciled to bank statement deposit of $155?Do credit card and eftpos sales go through as a separate receive money transaction?thanksCarina.
Here are is more on the wish list:- Ideally don't want to go through the merchant account headache anymore- Reasonable rates 3% or less, ideally not monthly fees on top- Can't have transaction limits - we may have it anywhere between $500 and $10,000 or more per transaction- Don't care so much about the manual reconciliation, automated is a plus but we can match manually for these are more of a one off- These are B2B transactions - reputation is extremely important, one of the reasons we can't go with PayPal Pro Any recommendations?Thanks in advance!

To reconcile it I've tried creating a spend money but then I can't figure out how to add the other lines so that the asset account and Owner's Funds Introduced are also listed.I feel like this is a simple thing but can't for the life of me figure it out.Hoping someone can help.
Is there any way to add aged balances to a customer statement, i.e, current, 30-60 days, 60-90 days etc?CheersMarcus

but in reality i received on 25th sept.Am i doing anything wrong?how to work around with this situation
I see that the dashboard has some visual reporting, but on the trial account it seems to lack in features.
thankyouIt would also be great to have more lines on an invoice without having to 'ádd line'
Then a purchase order can be edited by adding in Freight and other landed charges as credit amounts.
I suspect others might like to be able to measure income vs some other cost
Both the CBA and ANZ use MIGS to process online credit card transactions.
Often there may be additional specifications or plans that need to be sent to the supplier with the PO.
The Cash Summary Report could be used as the basis for a budget variance report.
Simple payslips more like invoices in Xero than payslips where we can do the salary deductions ourselves and a time sheet.
).So I'm no Xero expert, I'm also not a accounting software expert, and I'm certainly not a Odoo expert.
I have an employee that is taking leave but has not accrued enough hours for the entire period that are away.

TThe invoices paid by the company were costed to Cost of Goods Sold - is this not correct given the expenses don't relate to revenue generated by the business?Thanks
HI, I wanted to know when Xero will be integrating APPARELMAGIC, It shows it's coming soon on their website, but I wanted to double check before signing intthanks
manual journal), it would be great to have the same options as adding a new account with the Chart of Account settings, namely the ability to add a Reporting Name.
We have a client that would like this display updated so you view the post dated Xero balance in addition to the current day's Xero balance.
Before generating the invoice PDF we must double check the customer file to make sure the right name is in the attention field before printing.
Currently, if I reconcile these using Spend Money, instead of going into my 'suppliers' and creating a bill, then the transactions won't show on a report if I pull up all transactions for a supplier.
It would be great to include a SEARCH FUNCTION for these reports and be able to search by:- Customer / Supplier- Date (From / To)- Amount (Min / Max)- Reference No.
In the US case you need to address sales tax (and other taxes), payment gateways, even address format and probably many other things that i did not list.

Because we have a significant number of exchanges, I've created a liability account for the purpose of capturing these transactions.
Is it just a case of making the VAT rates and assigning them as defaults to the right accounts?
They billed us $750 this week and thus only paid $4250 this week.ThanksAndrew

I was thinking of creating a new account on the B/S – Insurance Premium (Current Liability).
Now when i input these items into my inventory does it still come out of cost of goods sold account?
I'm a little confused by the Account Payable module and its handling of credit card accounts.
Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?This is why I’m telling local, national, and even international companies to get on local!
However when importing sales invoices there is still no account number field on the CSV template.
So I think that could be very usefull that Xero has a report of operative cash flow.Let me explain !!
I changed the contact record assuming that it existing invoices that are linked to it would be updated but that was not the case.
It would be great if there was the option to attach a file to credit notes, as per invoices.
Currently, we just bill that one-off item separately but this can create a lot of invoices for clients.
1) Payments to personal CC are considered Director's Advances (Money paid to shareholders).
We started payroll in June last year and I had opening balances from our other accounting system.
I'm doing invoices through Freshbooks now and want to move to a full-featured hosted accounting system.

Hi,So from the latest updates Xero are working on reports at the moment to make them more flexible.What I would like to see is to filter the Sales by Item, or as it is now, the Inventory Item Summary by tracking catagory.
It would also be helpful to search all accounts of a certain type for a tracking division - eg - all expense or income accounts for Unassigned divisions.
Hello,This might be a really simple question but i'd like to deduct a small amount from an employee's salary (they bought a personal item).

Hello All, Am hoping you can provide insight as I have combed through discussion and the guide, but unable to find an answer.
How can I add money to my bank?Please help if you know how to solve this problem.Thank You for helps
I borrowed the money and then I lent the money (I'm getting a MUCH higher rate of return).
Once you have saved a draft report any subsequent changes to Report Fields do not pull through the the Report Template.
Currently every transaction has to be approved by clicking 'OK' in the bank reconciliation screen.
Several days later Amazon (as they do) invoiced it separately as 2 transactions ($400 & $600).
I'm not interested yet in paying additional money for an add-on so I'm looking for a work around.
Yay.You need to have an asset type for each separate cost/accumulated depreciation account.
What’s going to happen is, I’m going to give them $200 and they’re going to give me nothing.So, how do I account for this in Xero?
The HR company that we use recommend that we do a portion for "overtime allowance" so the 38 and the extra are separated.
They wish to do this and I don't see any reason why not.Another situation is if an employee wanted to trade in some leave for cash...

I am looking for an add-on to manage inventory right through the supply chain from growing to processing and sale.
But when I do this, I just get a single report send to Xero which I can't reconcile against the actual bank transactions in Xero.
CLUSTER 8810
But I would like to show these correctly as actual tax items that reduce the amount of money I owe the person I am purchasing from.
Here I mean, If I am tracking an item and the code changes, will the tracking pick up on this change or will I have two reports for the same item both pre and post code change?Hope that makes sense :-)Julian
I have a new Xero client who runs a virtual office and although they do occasionally work on an hourly rate, 99% of their work is per audio minute based.
