It would be awesome to have a Xero feed so you could combine your Xero data with other business & bigdata sources.
Our customers pay by monthly standing order in advance, based upon fixed fee quotations.
When you have multiple users, there is no way to insure that all entries are dated correctly and your income statements may be incorrect.
I recommend creating a 'blank' option so that all 'selected' dates in a batch can be modified/deleted at one time.
Ideally, this would be a branded area for your customers and suppliers to log into their accounts and view all their invoices to date.
It would be great and much more appropriate to have your employee's automatically populate this list, so you don't have to create a separate contact for them.
I assume this would be a quick process to address and a high priority?I look forward to your reply.Thank you.
