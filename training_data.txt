'Hi,I am trying to modify a paid invoice by changing the account_code for given line item.
I can modified unpaid invoice with out a problem.
However once the payment exist, I receive the error: "Invoice not of valid status for modification"
Which makes sense, however I was hoping since I am able to change the item account code easily on the web UI, even if an payment has been created,
    that I could do the same thing via the API.
Any ideas are highly appreciated,thank youJacob']

'Hi GuysI did a quick search for this but couldn\'t find an answer I was looking for.
The documentation describes:  "Daily Limit: 5000 calls in a rolling 24 hour window"At what time does the count reset?
Is this relative to the API token you are using and when this is created, or is it every 00:00UTC? or at some other time?
I\'d like to track the API calls we make to ensure we throttle properly so we never hit the limit,
    however thats difficult to program unless I know when the API limits are reset.
Thanks,Chris']

'Hi there,Firstly, apologies if this is in the wrong place.
There were at least 3 possible places this question could\'ve been created, but I figured as I\'m using wrapper code it should go here.
I\'m using the .NET Xero API SDK 2.0.20 in C#.I\'m trying to send an invoice to a customer upon payment.
It should be sent with the invoice in a paid state (so there is no confusion).
I\'ve got the code down good to apply the payment to the invoice, and sending the e-mail goes fine.
But then when we try to update the invoice to say it\'s been sent out, I get the following validation errors:* "Invoice not of valid status for modification"* "This document cannot be edited as it has a payment or credit note allocated to it."Here is some of the code I\'m using. {\t// bits and bobs to get the payment made\t_privateAppApi.Payments.Create(payment);\tEmailInvoice(payment);\tUpdateXeroInvoiceSentToContact(payment.Invoice);}private void UpdateXeroInvoiceSentToContact(XeroModels.Invoice invoice){\tinvoice.SentToContact = true;\t_privateAppApi.Invoices.Update(invoice);}Any ideas of how this could/should be handled? I thought about trying to set the sent status first, then applying the payment and then sending the e-mail. The problem with this approach is that I\'d get caught out again if something went wrong sending the e-mail, I wouldn\'t then be able to set SentToContact to false, because a payment has been applied. Which doesn\'t feel quite right.Any help appreciated.Cheers,Craig']

[46784, 'Storing Authentication or Organisation Details',
'We have developed an integration between our software (a .Net Winforms application) with Xero,
    allowing the user to import revenue and expense transactions using the API, into our software.
At the moment, every time the user wants to execute this import from within our software, they are presented with a Xero authentication page,
    where they enter in the username and password, and then on a second page, select the ‘organisation’ they want to allow our software to access
    (screenshot  https://www.screencast.com/t/JCwxMns3bW8 )I see that there is an ‘Allow access for 30 mins’ option,
    which saves them from having to login multiple times, however it still always prompts the user during this 30min period to select the Xero organisation.
Is it possible for us to capture and store their Xero username / password, and the organisation that they have originally selected, within our software,
    so we can programmatically use them in the future?
So each time they would want to execute an import, they won’t have to login or select their organisation again.
Is this possible to do with Xero?']

"Our AffinityLive product allows users to record expenses against a project.
In some cases they may not be personal expenses but ones paid for already by a business credit card or chequebook, etc.
We are wondering if these expenses can be pushed through to Xero via the API.
My understanding is that these are not Expense Claims assigned to a user, but are more general business expenses which are recorded differently.
We're a bit lost on how to proceed - part of the problem of course is that we're not accountants and may be taking the wrong approach!
Appreciate any advice."]
