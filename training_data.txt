(135142, 'How to handle a reduction of expenditure',
'I am struggling to sort out the best way to handle reconciling two transactions I have in Xero.
I have two separate vendors who issued partial refunds after a purchase was made.
One was because we were charged too much for shipping and the other because we were charged for an upgrade that we did not end up using.
Both of the original expenses were one off expenses paid via credit card and do not have associated bills.
They were just reconciled along with other bank transactions.
How do I handle the refunds?
They don\'t seem to be overpayments, and I don\'t have a bill to create a credit note against.
I could create bills but is that a best practice?
If I just choose to reconcile it and label is as "vendor refund" is it categorized as an asset or as revenue?Any guidance would be very much appreciated.
Thanks!'),
(126593, 'How to decide re: online payments?',
"Hi there — I am starting a business that is pretty straightforward wholesale distribution.
Payments will mostly come in via check, but many customers will pay via credit card.
I love the idea of being able to email an invoice to a customer with a big PAY NOW button, which will let them simply input their CC details secureley and pay their invoice.
This is a new venture for me, though, and I'm admittedly ignorant on the details and variables I should be considering when making this.
Which service should I integrate?
How do the services that integrate with Xero compare to setting up Merchant Services through my bank?
Would appreciate any guidance regarding how I might go about thinking about this problem and coming up with a good solution."),
(126082, 'Regular Loan Payments',
'Hi there,We use Capital On Tap as a regular loans service.
There is no option for bank feeds and the loan is paid in as and when we require it (almost like a transfer from a separate account with a loan limit).
We then have to pay back a minimum amount every month depending on the cumulative total we have loaned at the end of that month so the amount is never fixed, always variable.
I ideally want to record the capital we have received (ad hoc), the amount we have paid back (monthly) and the interest as an expense.
The loan was started before we began using Xero so I realise I will need to enter a conversion balance.
But I was wondering if anyone had any idea on how to go about recording the payments in, the repayments out and the interest.
Would I need to create two accounts, one for loan and one for loan interest?
I hope this makes sense and thanks in advance for any help or light you can shed on this.
Many thanks,Joe'),
(139105, 'Accounting for cash expenses paid from cash register',
'I\'m just starting to reconcile after adding Kounta integration, and am not sure how to handle cash purchases made from the cash register.
If a supplier is paid cash on delivery from the till, the deducted cash is recorded as "cash out" showing the reduced cash in the till.
How do I record this invoice paid by cash in Xero? The Kounta integration only shows the reduced cash in "cash register clearing account", not the COGS account.
When you receive a purchase order in Kounta it doesn\'t appear to allow you to specify how the invoice was paid.

"HiWe have some suppliers who have up to 70 invoices required for paymentTo avoid having to enter these all individually we create one purchase for the supplier,
    and in the body of the purchase, enter all the invoices. Of course we are unable to list every invoice number in the reference box, so we call it by the month of statement.
It makes it very easy then to identity, pick up & batch all bills that need to be paid at the end of the month, as they all have the same reference.
This works fine for us, but we do get requests from our suppliers as to what invoices we are paying, as the remittance only says 'April 17 Statement'.
Is there anyway to send a remittance with the body of the purchase showing?
Are we purchasing incorrectly?

"I have been advised by our accountant to put through a number of invoices from a client as a 'bad debt'.
I followed the forum posts and set up the account code and put through as credit notes but I'm told this isn't what they want.
Is it possible to put through a bad debt differently, such a journal entry, on an accrual scheme so that we can claim the VAT back but still
    leave the invoices open in case we do eventually get payments in?
We want to still be able to send statements etc, if requested, but adding a credit note to the invoices means that we are not able to do this as they're down as 'paid'."),

"Hi thereWe don't raise Xero invoices for our occasional suppliers, instead we'll simply create the transactions at reconciliation time,
    adding a new contact as necessary.My question is -  what's the easiest way to search for these transactions by contact name?
I had a case this morning where I needed to quickly add a file to a historical transaction for a known contact and I had to do the following:- Start at the dashboard.
    - Click on Accounts -> Bank Accounts- Click the correct bank account.- Click the 'Transactions' tab.- Click 'Search', enter the contact name.
    - Click the appropriate transaction from the list that appears.
That's quite laborious and also involves knowing which bank account the transaction belongs to.
What am I missing here?
I tried, instead, to do it via the 'Contacts' page, searched and found the correct contact, but there didn't seem to be a link to click through and view all
    transactions associated with that contact.
Frustratingly, I could see a bar graph, visualising the transaction amounts, but no obvious way to view them."),

"Hi,This is a more general question about physical inventory management and not necessarily related to Xero
    (but I figure that this is probably a good place to ask as I can't be the only person selling physical products).
My business is wholesale alcohol business and we have to do regular inventory counts in our multiple warehouses.
At the moment this is done manually on paper and then transferred to excel.
I would like to move to a more automated system where the person doing the inventory count scans a product barcode and types in the number of items in the warehouse.
If this can be achieved with a barcode scanner that links wirelessly to an app on a tablet or phone it would be great.
I've been trying to find suitable products to do this but haven't yet found the right solution.
How do other people handle this?
Are there any hardware / software solutions out there that you would recommend?
Thanks!Harold")]
